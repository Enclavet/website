# Technology Capabilities

## Packaging

### Templatizing Languages

The packaging and templatizing languages and frameworks are required to ensure the delivery of an end-to-end packaged up and functional set of tools endorsed and usable by the CNOE community. The packaging and templatizing frameworks should leave enough room for configurability of the framework to match the needs of its users, but take away the misconceptions or bad practices of configuring the combined set of tooling with one another. Some candidates for templating and packaging languages include the open component model, the Kubernetes packaging tool (KPT), and the OCI distribution specifications.

### Artifact Registries

The artifact registry allows for the packaged components endorsed by the CNOE community to be signed, accessible, and traceable for its users. By storing the list of components in an OCI registry or Git repository, the CNOE packaging framework will be able to deal with versioned and compatible artifacts that have already been tested and verified in working together. This also allows the combination of the registry and the packaging mechanism to undergo secure software supply chain (SSSC) best practices to further increase the level of confidence in leveraging these tools by the CNOE users.

## Delivery Components

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This entails tooling required to spin up infrastructure resources for a given application. We are seeing two categories of OSS tools in use at large, imperative infrastructure as code (Terraform, Pulumi, CDK) and declarative infrastructure as code (Crossplane or Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK)). The CNOE cohort will have to decide on the ideal IaC tool that works in tandem with the rest of delivery components, gains the overall community approval, and becomes the defacto service in use by the CNOE cohort.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous deliveryâ€™s ultimate goal is to get infrastructure and application resources into a state, ready for receiving production workload. GitOps is a new trend in continuous delivery where automation is put in place to ensure the desired state of the world matches the perceived state of the world. This is achieved by connecting the source of truth (usually a git repository holding definition of application and infrastructure resources) to a reconciling controller that ensures consistency of the spun up resource to what is stored in Git. ArgoCD and FluxCD are two prominent implementations of these CD practices. While very similar in nature, ArgoCD and FluxCD and the likes could work in tandem and are not mutually exclusive. Under the CD category, the CNOE community can help users evaluate which personas (e.g operator, developer) would be the most likely beneficiaries from each category of tooling. It is also worth noting that while GitOps is the dominant CD strategy in the CNCF space, it does not need to be the one or the only practice adopted by the CNOE users. Pluggability aspects of CNOE should ensure that customers have enough freedom in choosing their alternative.

### Workflow Orchestration
While CD ensures eventual rollout of artifacts into a customer environment (production, staging, or development), the process of getting artifacts ready for the ultimate rollout is achieved via workflow orchestration tooling. This involves running adequate tests, verifications, validations, and security hardening on the existing infrastructure and application resources as well as batch workloads, ML toolchains or any other data processing activities that need to be done a priori or in tandem with application rollout. Within the scope of CNOE, workflow orchestration also entails the set of activities deemed necessary as part of a continuous integration (CI) workflow. CNCF encapsulates a series of popular CI tools, namely, Tekton and Argo Workflows. Similar to the choice of CD, the CNOE packaging and rollout mechanism endorses a subset of these CI tools for deployment together with the rest of the tool chain to support the operational excellence expected by the CNOE community.

### Single Sign On & Federation
The CNOE toolset needs to guarantee seamless integration with the existing authentication and authorization mechanisms already available to a user organization. To this end, it should provide the necessary tooling required for such integration. Keycloak is an open source identity and access management tool that can be used to support this integration. Alternatively, integration with proprietary OIDC providers (such as Cognito, GitHub, etc.) needs to be supported.

### Observability

The overall well-being of the system is tracked via proper integration with state of the art observability tooling. Building on the existing set of technologies available in the CNCF ecosystem, CNOE needs to work in tandem with open telemetry data collectors and allow its users to view and analyze collected data using technologies such as Prometheus and Grafana.

### Developer Productivity

The CNOE cohort will work towards striking a balance on expectations across all its stake holders. This basically means that the set of tooling put together under CNOE will have to be as useful to the application developers as it is to other stakeholders. In order for this to be achieved, big emphasis is put on offering the right developer productivity tool that would serve as an overarching umbrella for including and presenting the underlying tooling in a user-friendly manner. Backstage is a popular open source tool supporting configurability and pluggability that can be utilized to achieve such level of developer productivity.
