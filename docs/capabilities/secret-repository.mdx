# Secret Repositories

- Secrets repositories are secure long term storage locations for sensitive data. 
- They parallel the centralized storage, versioning and meta-data capabilities offered by configuration repositories, but usually with stricter access controls and auditing.
- The storage of secrets should be encrypted. They may be encrypted with Hardware Security Modules or HSMs.
- They may be used in conjunction with other encryption and cryptographic solutions like Public Key Infrastructure or PKI.
- Secrets repositories may also offer the ability to lease, rotate and revoke certain types of secrets.
- Common tooling includes:
  - Hashicorp Vault
  - Cyberark Conjur
  - AWS Secrets Manager
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Google Secret Manager
