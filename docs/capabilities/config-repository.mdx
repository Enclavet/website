# Config Repositories

- Similar to the code repositories but specific to application configuration
- Often takes the form of serialized key value pairs or similar simple data structures.
- Should not contain embedded secrets but often contains references to secrets that can be found within secret repositories.
- Frequently appended with meta-data about environment specifics
- Should be versioned and immutable
