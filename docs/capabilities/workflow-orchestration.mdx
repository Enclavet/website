- The orchestration process to get artifacts ready for rollout
- This involves defining the set of activities deemed necessary as part of CI, including but not limited to running tests (unit test, smoke tests, integration tests, acceptance tests, etc),, validations, verifications, and configuration changes to the deployment environments
