# Deployment Targets

- These are the runtime environments that product apps and services run on. They could also be abstractions hiding the details and fidelity of the underlying environments from the product developers. 
- An example of something that we might want to hide from users is the region or locality of the environment.
- Common deployment targets include:
  - Kubernetes
  - Lambda
  - Virtual Machines (EC2)
  - Elastic Container Service (ECS)
