# Packaging and Templating

The packaging and templatizing languages and frameworks are required to ensure the delivery of a packaged up and functional set of tools endorsed and usable by the CNOE community. The packaging and templatizing frameworks should leave enough room for configurability of the framework to match the needs of its users, but take away the misconceptions or bad practices of configuring the combined set of tooling with one another. Some candidates for templating and packaging languages include the open component model, the Kubernetes packaging tool (KPT), and the OCI distribution specifications.

- Packaging up the functional set of tools endorsed and usable by the CNOE community
- It should leave enough room for configurability of the system
- Needs to take away misconceptions and bad practices as part of configurability best practices
