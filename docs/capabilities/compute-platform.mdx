# Compute Platform

- This is the platform runtime. It can also be thought of as a deployment target for the applications that make up the platform.
- Offers some formalized patterns for interoperability between platform capabilities.
- Can offer similar discoverability and uniformity as that of service oriented architectures (SOA)
- Can also offer a common medium for data exchange between services like an enterprise service bus or (ESB)
- Frequently Kubernetes is the compute and also the substrate for the foundation of platform capabilities.
