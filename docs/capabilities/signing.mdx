# Signing

- Cryptographic signing of artifacts, be they source code commits, configurations, binaries or other, allow for verification of the consistency and integrity of the data they contain.
- Cryptographic signatures can also provide provenance data (lineage and chain of custody). 
- When combined with attestations (meta-data with a specific predicate in regards to the material being signed) they can be used to build up “trust telemetry” or verifiable signals about the material and how it was processed. These are foundational elements of a Secure Software Supply Chain.
- Common tools to perform signing include:
  - Sigstore
  - PGP
  - PKCS #11
